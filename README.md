# Boundless: Synthetic Data Generation for Urban Object Detection
Boundless is a photo-realistic synthetic data generation system for enabling highly accurate object detection in dense urban streetscapes. It is based on the Unreal Engine 5 City Sample project with improvements for accurate 3D bounding box collection across different lighting and scene variability conditions.
## Overview
Boundless aims to replace massive real-world data collection and manual ground-truth object annotation with an automated and configurable process. It generates synthetic image datasets that can be used to train object detection models for urban environments, particularly for medium-altitude camera perspectives where real-world training data is scarce.
## Key Features

* Dynamic lighting and weather conditions (rain, snow, dust, heat waves)
* Improved anti-aliasing for higher quality frame rendering
* Enhanced level of detail for distant objects
* Accurate 3D and 2D bounding box generation
* Export options in KITTI and YOLO formats
* Digital twin capability for replicating real-world intersections

## Dataset

We provide datasets generated with the simulator for training object detection models. The provided datasets are formatted in the YOLO dataset format.

* TBD
